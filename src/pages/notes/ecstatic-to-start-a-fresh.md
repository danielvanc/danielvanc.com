description: Welcome to my new site! Over the last 10 years or so, danielvanc.com has seen a re-design or 2. Infact, 7 or 8 is probably a more accurate number. Something I'm ashamed to admit. And a common theme in which I fail to do, with every re-launch, is committing myself to maintaining it. Though the previous iterations have done pretty well (if feedback is anything to go by), the effort and time I've put into each one, initially, has gone to waste.

It's time to change that. I haven't felt this excited towards my own projects, as I have now, and am completely focused on making progress with all my current ideas. So keep track on [what i'm currently focusing on](/now "what i'm currently focusing on"), where you'll get an insight of what's new and existing features are being worked on. Bug fix updates and feature releases will be posted to the [Log page](/log "Log") page, on a per month basis.

### In other related news:

In mid 2018, I spent a considerable amount of time reviewing my current tech stack, for front-end development.  After careful consideration and thorough research, I made the conscious decision to head down the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/ "JAMStack") route. My tooling of choice includes: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ "ReactJS"), [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/ "GatsbyJS"), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/ "GraphQL") and more. Expect a write up on this later. 

So with those updates, Iâ€™m happy to announce that danielvanc.com is now completely static! Yey to no more server rendering! Powered by [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/ "GatsbyJS"), content managed with [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org/ "Netlify CMS") and has automatic deployment to [Netlify](https://netlify.com/ "Netlify") via GitHub! Yep, the site is also now completely [public and open source](https://github.com/danielvanc/danielvanc.com "public and open source"), feel free to browser around, fork and contribute! 

I'm so excited where this is heading and look forward to what's coming next!
