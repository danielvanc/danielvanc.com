description: Over the last 10 years or so, danielvanc.com has seen a re-design or 2. Infact, 7 or 8 is probably a more accurate figure. Something I'm ashamed of, because a common theme in which I've failed on with every re-launch, is committing myself to maintaining it. Though the previous iterations have done pretty well (if feedback is anything to go by), the effort and time I've initially put in to each one, has simply gone to waste. So I admit, I've struggled with my own site.

It's time to put an end to all that and focus on putting more effort into this and my overall personal branding. There has never come a better time to be so keen and excited to work towards my own projects.  
So with that in mind, keep track on [what i'm focusing on](/now "what i'm currently focusing on") for the current month. Which includes an overview of which new and existing features are being worked on. All new releases are documented on the [Log](/log "Log") page.

### In other related news:

In mid 2018, I spent a considerable amount of time reviewing my current tech stack, for front-end development.  After careful consideration and thorough research, I made the conscious decision to head down the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/ "JAMStack") route. My tooling of choice includes: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ "ReactJS"), [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/ "GatsbyJS"), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/ "GraphQL") and more. Expect a write up on this later. 

Additionally, Iâ€™m happy to announce that danielvanc.com is now completely **static**! Thanks to [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/ "GatsbyJS"). Content is managed with [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org/ "Netlify CMS"), with automatic deployment and hosting on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/ "Netlify") via the sites [GitHub repo](https://github.com/danielvanc/danielvanc.com "GitHub repo")!

I'm really looking forward to seeing where things go!
